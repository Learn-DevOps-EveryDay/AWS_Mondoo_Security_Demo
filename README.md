# AWS Terraform Mondoo Security Demo

## Project Goal: Shift-Left DevSecOps with Terraform

This project demonstrates the integration of **security-as-code** principles into the **AWS infrastructure lifecycle**. The core focus is on performing **static security analysis** and **policy compliance checks** *before* the code is provisioned, using **Terraform** for IaC using **Checkov & Mondoo/cnspec** for security assessment.

---


## Whatis in the Repository ?

1. AWS resources using Terraform scripts and modules.
2. Pipeline as code using GitHub Actions to execute Terraform modules to provision as well as destroy aws resources.
3. Terraform Static Code Analysis using Checov/Cnspec.
4. Terraform Compliance testing.

## Current Learning Focus and Roadmap

This project is a continuous learning exercise in advancing DevSecOps practices. My current goals include:

1.  **Live Environment Scanning Pipeline:** I am actively working on implementing a **separate CI/CD pipeline** dedicated to scanning the **live AWS environment**. This ensures continuous security assessment of deployed resources, complementing the static analysis performed here.
2.  **Custom Policy Development:** I am trying to build a library of **custom security policies** tailored to organizational needs, leveraging the power of **Mondoo Query Language (MQL)** and executing these checks using `cnspec`.

## CI/CD Workflow: Conditional Execution

This pipeline is executed using `workflow_dispatch`, allowing the user to select the security scanner and explicitly choose between an **Apply** run or a dedicated **Destroy** run.

### Workflow Inputs

| Input | Description | Options |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `securityScan` | Selects the IaC security scanner for Stage 1. | `checkov`, `mondoo`, `none` |
| `enableDestroy` | If set to `true`, the pipeline skips Stage 1 & 2 (Apply) and executes **Stage 3 (Destroy)**. | `true`, `false` |

### Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Job | Condition | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trigger** | (N/A) | `on: workflow_dispatch` | Developer triggers run and selects security/action. |
| **Stage 1: Security Scan** | `checkov` or `mondoo_scan` | Runs **ONLY IF** `enableDestroy` is `false`. | Static analysis of IaC code. Failure requires code fix. |
| **Stage 2: Plan & Apply** | `terraform` | Runs **ONLY IF** `enableDestroy` is `false`. | **Init**, **Plan** (`tfplan`), **Apply** (`apply -auto-approve tfplan`). |
| **Stage 3: Destroy** | `destroy` | Runs **ONLY IF** `enableDestroy` is `true`. | **Init**, then **Destroy** (`destroy -auto-approve`) for mandatory cleanup. |

## Technologies Used

| Technology | Role in Project |
| :--- | :--- |
| **AWS** | Cloud platform hosting the infrastructure. |
| **Terraform** | IaC tool for provisioning and managing resources. |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD platform automating all stages. |
| **Mondoo / cnspec** | Policy-as-Code for security compliance checks (MQL is used for custom policies). |
| **Checkov** | Static analysis tool for validating Terraform code. |

## Local Development and Execution

### Prerequisites

1.  An **AWS account** with configured credentials.
2.  **Terraform**, **Checkov** and **Mondoo/cnspec** installed locally.

### Local Steps

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Learn-DevOps-EveryDay/AWS_Mondoo_Security_Demo.git](https://github.com/Learn-DevOps-EveryDay/AWS_Mondoo_Security_Demo.git)
    cd AWS_Mondoo_Security_Demo
    ```

2.  **Run Local Static Checks:**
    ```bash
    # Checkov
    checkov -d terraform-project/
    
    # Mondoo/cnspec
    cnspec scan terraform terraform-project/
    ```

3. **Terraform Lifecycle**
    ```bash
        # Format Terraform code
        terraform fmt -recursive

        # Initialize Terraform
        terraform init

        # Validate Terraform code
        terraform validate

        # Preview the execution plan
        terraform plan

        # Apply the changes
        terraform apply -auto-approve

        # Destroy resources (cleanup)
        terraform destroy -auto-approve
    ```
